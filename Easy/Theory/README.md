_HTML_

1.What are the Meta Tags and Explain them?
Ans. Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content; the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code. Meta tags are essentially little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.

_CSS_

1. Box Model
   Ans. The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. According to the CSS box model, the web browser supplies each element as a square prism.
   _Properties of the Box Model_
   There are several properties in the CSS box model. They are as mentioned below:

Content
The content area consists of content like image, text, or other forms of media content. The height and width properties help to modify the box dimensions.

Padding
The padding area is the space around the content area and within the border-box. It can be applied to all sides of the box or to the specific, selected side(s) - top, right, bottom, and/or left.

Border
The border area surrounds the padding and the content, and can be applied to all the sides of the box or to selected side(s) - top, right, bottom, and/or left.

Margin
The margin area consists of space between the border and the margin. The margin does not possess its own background color and is completely transparent. It shows the background color of the element, like the body element.

3.Diff. between class selector and ID selector
Ans. The basic difference between ID and Class is that the ID selector is applied only to one element in a page, whereas the class selector can be applied to several elements on a single page.

4.Position Properties
Ans. The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

5.Properties of flexbox
Ans. Parent properties:
display defines a flex container â€“ flex formatting context.
flex-direction defines the main axis inside the container.
flex-wrap allows flex items to wrap onto more than one line.
flex-flow shorthand for flex-direction + flex-wrap.
justify-content allows items to align along main axis.
align-content allows items to align along cross axis in a single line.
align-items aligns multiple lines of items on the cross axis.

Children/Flex-items properties:
order allows the change of order of items without altering the source order.
flex-grow allows an item to fill up the available free space.
flex-shrink allows an item to shrink if there is no enough free space available.
flex-basis defines the size of an item before space is distributed.
flex is the shorthand for flex-grow + flex-shrink + flex-basis.
flex-self has the ability to align one single item within the flex container.

6.What are the different types of Selectors in CSS?
Ans. CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
